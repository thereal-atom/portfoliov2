Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a 16 year old, self-taught, full-stack web developer with over 2 years of experience. I code in Typescript and use Node.js, express.js, tRPC, SvelteKit, Tailwind, Python, Django, Rust, Next.js and more. Along with web, I am learning systems engineering, machine learning and DevOps.

I am currently open to contributing to a project or joining a team part time (I still go to school) as a web developer or systems engineer (anything really). I am also open to freelance work. Contact me to request my resume.

### Artificial Neural Network Implementation

![ann-implementation](https://i.ibb.co/CtND0XB/Screenshot-20230226-144810.png)

This is the an implementation of an artificial neural network in Rust (originally in TypeScript). Using calculus and linear algebra, I coded up a simple neural network from scratch. Itâ€™s not the most performant, but it taught me about the  mathematical principals that go into create a neural network.

I wrote an article about this project [here](https://oscarfal.hashnode.dev)

**Stack**

- Rust
- Typescript
